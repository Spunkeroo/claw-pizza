    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What flour is best for New York style pizza dough?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Bread flour with 12-13% protein content produces the best New York style pizza dough. The higher protein creates more gluten, which gives the crust its characteristic chew and structure. King Arthur Bread Flour (12.7% protein) and General Mills All Trumps (14.2% protein) are both excellent choices. All-purpose flour (10-11% protein) will work but produces a softer, less chewy crust. Italian 00 flour is designed for Neapolitan pizza and is too fine for NY style. The protein content is the single most important factor in flour selection for this style of pizza."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long should New York pizza dough ferment?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The ideal fermentation for New York style pizza dough is a cold ferment in the refrigerator for 24-72 hours. A minimum of 24 hours develops basic flavor. 48 hours produces noticeably better flavor with more complexity. 72 hours is considered the sweet spot by most pizzaiolos, producing deep, slightly tangy flavor with excellent texture. The cold temperature slows yeast activity, which creates more complex flavor compounds through extended fermentation. Same-day dough (2-4 hours at room temperature) will work in a pinch but lacks the depth of flavor that cold fermentation provides."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can you make good pizza in a regular home oven?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. While NYC pizzerias use deck ovens at 550-650 degrees Fahrenheit, a home oven at 500-550 degrees with a pizza steel or stone produces excellent results. The key is preheating the steel or stone for at least 45-60 minutes so it stores enough thermal energy to quickly cook the bottom of the pizza. A pizza steel conducts heat better than a stone and is the single best upgrade for home pizza making. Position the steel on the top rack, about 6 inches from the broiler. Bake at maximum oven temperature for 5-7 minutes, then finish with 1-2 minutes under the broiler for char on top."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the best cheese for New York style pizza?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella is the traditional cheese for New York style pizza. It melts into a smooth, stretchy layer without releasing excess water. Grande, Galbani, and Polly-O are preferred brands. Pre-shredded cheese from bags contains anti-caking agents (cellulose) that prevent proper melting, so always buy blocks and shred yourself. Some pizzerias mix in a small amount of provolone (10-15%) for added flavor. Fresh mozzarella is too wet for NY style and makes the pizza soggy. The cheese should be shredded, not sliced, for even coverage and melting."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Why does my homemade pizza dough shrink back when I stretch it?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Dough that springs back is under-relaxed. The gluten network is too tight and needs more time to relax. There are two solutions. First, let the dough ball sit at room temperature for at least 60-90 minutes before stretching. Cold dough is tight and elastic. Warm dough is pliable and cooperative. Second, if the dough keeps snapping back during stretching, set it down, cover it, and wait 10-15 minutes. This gives the gluten time to relax. Then resume stretching. Never use a rolling pin on NY style dough because it crushes the air bubbles and produces a cracker-like texture instead of the characteristic puffed, charred edge."}}

<h2 id="dough">The Dough: Foundation of Everything</h2>

<p>New York pizza dough is a lean dough, meaning it contains flour, water, salt, yeast, and a small amount of oil. There is no sugar, no eggs, no milk, no butter. The simplicity of the ingredient list means that technique and timing matter enormously. The dough is what separates mediocre homemade pizza from excellent homemade pizza.</p>

<h3>The Recipe (Makes 3 Large Pies, 16-18 Inches Each)</h3>

<div class="recipe-box">
<h3>New York Style Pizza Dough</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bread flour:</strong> 500g (about 4 cups) - 12-13% protein content</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> 325g (1.37 cups) - 65% hydration, room temperature</li>
<li><strong>Fine sea salt:</strong> 10g (1.75 teaspoons) - 2% of flour weight</li>
<li><strong>Instant dry yeast:</strong> 1.5g (0.5 teaspoon) - 0.3% of flour weight</li>
<li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> 15g (1 tablespoon) - 3% of flour weight</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Baker's Percentages Explained</h3>
<p>Professional bakers express recipes as percentages of flour weight. In this recipe: 100% flour, 65% water, 2% salt, 0.3% yeast, 3% oil. This lets you scale the recipe to any size. Want 4 pies? Use 667g flour and multiply every other ingredient by the same factor (667/500 = 1.334). Baker's percentages are the universal language of bread baking and once you understand them, you can scale any recipe instantly.</p>

<h3>Why 65% Hydration?</h3>
<p>Hydration is the ratio of water to flour. New York style pizza uses 62-67% hydration. Lower hydration (62%) produces a stiffer, easier-to-handle dough with a crisper texture. Higher hydration (67%) produces a more extensible dough with larger bubbles and a lighter chew. We recommend 65% as the sweet spot for home bakers. It is wet enough for good texture but manageable enough to stretch without tearing. As your skills improve, experiment with higher hydration for a lighter, more open crumb.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Dough Process</h3>

<p><strong>Step 1: Combine dry ingredients.</strong> In a large bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and instant yeast together. Distributing the yeast and salt evenly through the flour before adding water ensures even fermentation. Do not let the salt and yeast touch directly before mixing, as concentrated salt can kill yeast cells.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Add water and oil.</strong> Pour the room temperature water and olive oil into the flour mixture. Use a wooden spoon or your hand to stir until no dry flour remains. The dough will look shaggy and rough. This is normal. Do not knead yet.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Rest 20 minutes (autolyse).</strong> Cover the bowl and let the dough sit for 20 minutes. During this rest, the flour fully hydrates and gluten begins developing on its own. This reduces the total kneading time and produces a more extensible dough.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Knead 8-10 minutes.</strong> Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should pass the windowpane test: tear off a small piece and stretch it thin enough to see light through it without it breaking. If it tears, knead for 2 more minutes and test again. You can also knead in a stand mixer with the dough hook on medium-low for 6-8 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Bulk ferment 1 hour.</strong> Form the dough into a smooth ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature for 1 hour. It should increase in volume by about 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Divide and ball.</strong> Turn the dough onto a clean surface and divide it into 3 equal pieces (about 280g each for a 16-inch pie). Shape each piece into a tight, smooth ball by tucking the edges underneath and rotating against the counter. The surface tension you create during balling helps the dough hold its shape during stretching.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7: Cold ferment 24-72 hours.</strong> Place each dough ball in an individual oiled container with a lid, or on a sheet tray covered tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours. 48-72 hours produces the best flavor. The cold temperature slows the yeast, allowing complex flavor compounds to develop that rapid fermentation cannot produce. This is the single most important step for flavor. Do not skip it.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>Pro Tip: The 72-Hour Dough</h3>
<p>If you plan ahead, a 72-hour cold ferment transforms pizza dough. The extended fermentation produces subtle tangy, yeasty, almost beer-like flavor notes that you cannot get any other way. The texture also improves: the gluten relaxes more fully, making the dough easier to stretch, and the long fermentation creates a more open, airy crumb structure. Most award-winning pizzerias use 48-72 hour fermented dough. Start your dough on Wednesday for Saturday pizza night.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="sauce">The Sauce: Simple, Raw, Tangy</h2>

<p>Authentic New York pizza sauce is not cooked before it goes on the pizza. It is raw crushed tomatoes seasoned simply and applied directly to the stretched dough. The sauce cooks on the pizza in the oven. This is critical because cooking the sauce before baking produces a sweeter, jam-like flavor that is characteristic of other pizza styles, not New York.</p>

<h3>The Recipe (Makes Enough for 3-4 Pies)</h3>

<div class="recipe-box">
<h3>New York Style Pizza Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>San Marzano tomatoes:</strong> 1 can (28 oz) whole peeled, drained of excess juice</li>
<li><strong>Fine sea salt:</strong> 0.5 teaspoon</li>
<li><strong>Dried oregano:</strong> 0.5 teaspoon</li>
<li><strong>Garlic powder:</strong> 0.25 teaspoon</li>
<li><strong>Red pepper flakes:</strong> pinch (optional)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>Process:</strong> Drain the tomatoes of excess juice (you want the thick pulp, not the watery liquid). Crush the tomatoes by hand or pulse 3-4 times in a food processor. You want a chunky-smooth texture, not a puree. Stir in the salt, oregano, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. That is it. No cooking. The entire process takes under 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>Why San Marzano Tomatoes?</h3>
<p>San Marzano tomatoes (DOP certified, grown in the San Marzano region of Italy) have a sweeter, less acidic flavor with thicker flesh and fewer seeds than standard canned tomatoes. They produce a more balanced sauce that does not become overly acidic during baking. If genuine San Marzano tomatoes are unavailable or too expensive ($4-6 per can), Cento, Bianco DiNapoli, and Stanislaus (7/11 brand) are excellent alternatives that professional pizzerias use.</p>

<h3>How Much Sauce Per Pizza?</h3>
<p>Use 3-4 tablespoons of sauce per 16-inch pie. New York style pizza uses less sauce than you think. Spread it in a thin, even layer using the back of a spoon in concentric circles, leaving a 0.5-inch border for the crust. Too much sauce makes the center soggy and prevents the cheese from browning properly. The sauce should barely cover the dough, not pool on it.</p>

<h2 id="cheese">The Cheese: Low-Moisture Mozzarella</h2>

<p>New York style pizza uses whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella. This is not the same as fresh mozzarella (which is too wet) or part-skim mozzarella (which is too rubbery). Whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella melts into a smooth, stretchy, golden-brown layer that defines the New York pizza experience.</p>

<h3>Best Cheese Brands</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grande:</strong> The gold standard. Used by most serious pizzerias in the Northeast. Exceptional melt and flavor. Available at restaurant supply stores and some Costco locations.</li>
<li><strong>Galbani:</strong> Widely available at grocery stores. Excellent quality and consistent melt. The whole milk block (not pre-shredded) is the one to buy.</li>
<li><strong>Polly-O:</strong> A New York institution. Good flavor and melt. Available at most supermarkets in the dairy section.</li>
<li><strong>Boar's Head:</strong> Available at deli counters. Good quality whole milk mozzarella with proper melt characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Critical rule:</strong> Never use pre-shredded mozzarella from bags. It contains cellulose (wood pulp) and potato starch as anti-caking agents. These prevent the cheese from melting properly and create a grainy texture. Always buy blocks and shred yourself using the large holes on a box grater. The 30 seconds of extra work produces dramatically better results.</p>

<h3>How Much Cheese Per Pizza?</h3>
<p>Use 8-10 ounces (225-280g) of shredded mozzarella per 16-inch pie. Distribute evenly over the sauce, all the way to the edge of the sauce but not onto the crust border. Some pizzerias mix 10-15% aged provolone with the mozzarella for additional flavor depth. A light dusting of grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan over the top adds a sharp, salty accent that elevates the pizza significantly.</p>

<h2 id="technique">Stretching and Shaping Technique</h2>

<p>Proper dough handling is what separates great pizza from good pizza. The goal is a thin, even center (about 3mm thick) with a puffed, airy edge (the cornicione) that chars and bubbles in the oven.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Temper the Dough</h3>
<p>Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator 60-90 minutes before you plan to stretch it. Cold dough is tight and elastic. Room temperature dough is relaxed and cooperative. This step is non-negotiable. Trying to stretch cold dough results in tearing and snapback.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Flour Your Surface</h3>
<p>Use a generous amount of flour (or a 50/50 mix of flour and semolina) on your work surface and on the dough ball. New York pizza dough is stretched on a floured surface, not an oiled one. The flour prevents sticking while allowing the dough to slide during stretching. Too little flour causes the dough to grip the surface and tear.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Press and Flatten</h3>
<p>Place the dough ball on the floured surface. Using your fingertips, press from the center outward, leaving a 0.5-inch border untouched. This border becomes the cornicione. Press firmly enough to flatten the center but gently enough to preserve the gas bubbles in the edge. Flip the dough over and repeat. You should have a disc about 8-10 inches across.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Stretch by Draping</h3>
<p>Pick up the dough disc and drape it over your fists (knuckles up, fingers tucked). Gravity will begin stretching the dough. Rotate the dough slowly on your fists, letting gravity do the work. Occasionally give a gentle stretch by moving your fists apart. Work your way around the entire circumference. The dough should stretch to 14-16 inches. If it springs back, set it down, cover it, wait 10 minutes, then resume.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Transfer to Peel</h3>
<p>Lay the stretched dough on a floured pizza peel (or a floured inverted sheet tray). Reshape into a circle if needed. Give the peel a gentle shake to confirm the dough slides freely. If it sticks, lift the edge and add more flour underneath. Top the pizza while it is on the peel, working quickly so the dough does not stick.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>The Cardinal Rule of NY Pizza</h3>
<p>Never use a rolling pin on New York style pizza dough. A rolling pin crushes the gas bubbles in the dough, producing a dense, cracker-like crust instead of the airy, chewy, charred edge that defines NY style. Hand stretching preserves the bubble structure. It takes practice, but even imperfect hand-stretched dough produces better results than rolled dough. Uneven thickness is fine and actually desirable: it creates variation in texture that makes each bite interesting.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="baking">Baking: Maximum Heat, Minimum Time</h2>

<p>New York pizzerias bake at 550-650 degrees Fahrenheit in deck ovens. Your home oven maxes out at 500-550 degrees. The solution is a pizza steel (or stone) that stores thermal energy and rapidly transfers it to the bottom of the pizza.</p>

<h3>Pizza Steel vs. Pizza Stone</h3>
<p>A pizza steel is a 0.25-0.375 inch thick plate of steel that you place on the top rack of your oven. Steel conducts heat 18 times faster than ceramic stone, producing a crispier bottom in less time. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=pizza+steel+baking&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pizza steel costs $60-90</a> and is the single best investment you can make for home pizza. If you already own a pizza stone, it will work, but a steel produces noticeably better results. Never buy a thin pizza stone; it must be at least 0.5 inches thick to store adequate heat.</p>

<h3>Oven Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Position the steel on the top rack,</strong> about 6-8 inches from the broiler element. This allows radiant heat from the broiler to char the top of the pizza while the steel cooks the bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Preheat at maximum temperature for 45-60 minutes.</strong> The steel needs time to absorb heat. A quick preheat produces an undercooked bottom. Set your oven to its maximum bake temperature (usually 500-550 degrees) and let it preheat for a full hour.</li>
<li><strong>Bake for 5-7 minutes on bake mode.</strong> Launch the pizza from the peel onto the steel. Bake until the bottom is golden and the cheese is melted and beginning to brown.</li>
<li><strong>Finish with 1-2 minutes under the broiler.</strong> Switch the oven to broil for the final 1-2 minutes. Watch carefully since the broiler can burn the pizza in seconds. You want leopard-spot char on the crust and bubbling, browned cheese. Remove immediately when the desired char is achieved.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Launch</h3>
<p>Launching (sliding the pizza from the peel onto the steel) is the most nerve-wracking moment for beginners. The key is a well-floured peel and a quick, confident motion. Give the peel a test shake before you approach the oven. If the pizza slides freely, you are good. If it sticks, lift the edge and add more flour. To launch, hold the peel at a slight downward angle at the back edge of the steel and pull the peel sharply toward you. The pizza should slide off and land on the steel. Practice improves this quickly.</p>

<h2 id="toppings">Classic New York Toppings</h2>

<h3>The Plain Slice (Cheese Pizza)</h3>
<p>The plain cheese slice is the benchmark of any pizzeria. If the cheese pizza is not excellent, nothing else matters. Sauce, mozzarella, a drizzle of olive oil, and a dusting of dried oregano and grated Pecorino Romano after baking. This is the purest expression of New York pizza and the version you should master before adding toppings.</p>

<h3>The Pepperoni Slice</h3>
<p>Cup-and-char pepperoni (also called natural casing pepperoni) is the most popular New York pizza topping. Small-diameter pepperoni with natural casings curl up during baking, forming crispy cups that hold pools of rendered fat. Look for Ezzo, Margherita, or Vermont Smoke and Cure brands. Place pepperoni on top of the cheese (not under it) so they are exposed to direct heat and char properly. Use about 40-50 pieces per 16-inch pie.</p>

<h3>Other Classic NY Toppings</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sausage:</strong> Remove Italian sausage from casings and pinch into small pieces. Scatter raw over the cheese. It cooks during baking.</li>
<li><strong>Mushrooms:</strong> Slice thin and place on raw. They will release moisture during baking and concentrate in flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Green peppers and onions:</strong> Slice thin. These go on raw and soften during baking.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh garlic:</strong> Slice thin or mince. Place on the sauce before adding cheese. Roasts during baking for sweet, caramelized garlic flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Ricotta:</strong> Dollop small spoonfuls over the cheese for a white pizza element. Use whole milk ricotta, never part-skim.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topping Rules</h3>
<p>Less is more. Overloading toppings makes the center soggy and prevents the dough from cooking through. Use 2-3 toppings maximum. Wet ingredients (fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers) should be patted dry before placing on the pizza. Toppings go on top of the cheese in New York style, not under it. The cheese layer seals the dough from moisture and prevents sogginess.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Common Problems</h2>

<h3>Problem: Soggy Center</h3>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong> Too much sauce, too many wet toppings, oven not hot enough, steel not preheated long enough, or dough stretched too thin in the center. <strong>Fixes:</strong> Use 3-4 tablespoons of sauce maximum. Reduce toppings. Preheat steel for a full hour. Ensure the center is uniformly about 3mm thick, not paper thin.</p>

<h3>Problem: Dough Tears During Stretching</h3>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong> Dough is too cold, under-fermented, over-kneaded, or the flour had insufficient protein. <strong>Fixes:</strong> Let dough come to full room temperature (60-90 minutes). Ensure at least 24 hours of cold fermentation. Knead until just past the windowpane test, not longer. Use bread flour with 12%+ protein.</p>

<h3>Problem: Crust Is Not Crispy</h3>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong> Oven temperature too low, steel not preheated enough, too much moisture from sauce or toppings. <strong>Fixes:</strong> Use maximum oven temperature. Preheat for a full hour. Use a pizza steel instead of a stone. Reduce sauce and topping quantities. Finish with the broiler for additional top heat.</p>

<h3>Problem: Cheese Does Not Brown</h3>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong> Part-skim mozzarella (less fat = less browning), pre-shredded cheese (anti-caking agents interfere), or no broiler finish. <strong>Fixes:</strong> Use whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella. Shred from a block. Finish with 1-2 minutes under the broiler. A light dusting of Pecorino Romano also promotes browning.</p>

<h3>Problem: Dough Sticks to the Peel</h3>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong> Insufficient flour on the peel, wet dough, or the pizza sat on the peel too long. <strong>Fixes:</strong> Use generous flour or semolina on the peel. Top the pizza quickly (under 60 seconds). Give the peel a test shake before approaching the oven. If stuck, lift the edge and blow flour underneath.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Essential and Optional Equipment</h2>

<h3>Essential (Under $100 Total)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kitchen scale ($15-25):</strong> Measuring by weight is the only way to get consistent dough. Volume measurements (cups) are inaccurate. A $15 digital kitchen scale transforms your baking. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kitchen+scale+digital&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browse kitchen scales on Amazon</a></li>
<li><strong>Pizza peel ($15-30):</strong> A wooden peel for launching and a metal peel for retrieving. The wooden surface grips flour and prevents sliding during topping. The thin metal edge slides easily under a baked pizza.</li>
<li><strong>Pizza steel ($60-90):</strong> The single best upgrade for home pizza. A 0.25-0.375 inch steel plate that conducts heat faster than stone, producing a crispier bottom.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optional Upgrades</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrared thermometer ($15-25):</strong> Measures the surface temperature of your steel or stone to confirm it is fully preheated. Target 500+ degrees Fahrenheit on the surface.</li>
<li><strong>Dough containers ($10-20 for a set):</strong> Round, stackable containers with lids for cold-fermenting individual dough balls. Easier than sheet trays and plastic wrap.</li>
<li><strong>Pizza screen ($5-10):</strong> A mesh aluminum disc that provides an alternative to launching directly onto the steel. Place the pizza on the screen, then on the steel. Remove the screen halfway through baking for direct contact.</li>
<li><strong>Ooni or Gozney pizza oven ($300-600):</strong> Outdoor pizza ovens that reach 900+ degrees Fahrenheit, producing 60-90 second Neapolitan-style pizzas. Not necessary for NY style but incredibly fun.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq">
<details>
<summary>What flour is best for New York style pizza dough?</summary>
<p>Bread flour with 12-13% protein content. The higher protein creates more gluten for characteristic chew. King Arthur Bread Flour (12.7% protein) is excellent. All-purpose flour works but produces a softer crust. Italian 00 flour is designed for Neapolitan pizza and is too fine for NY style.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long should New York pizza dough ferment?</summary>
<p>Cold ferment in the refrigerator for 24-72 hours. 24 hours is the minimum for basic flavor. 48 hours is noticeably better. 72 hours is the sweet spot with deep, complex flavor. Same-day dough (2-4 hours at room temperature) works in a pinch but lacks the depth of cold fermentation.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you make good pizza in a regular home oven?</summary>
<p>Yes. A home oven at 500-550 degrees with a pizza steel produces excellent results. Preheat the steel for 45-60 minutes, bake for 5-7 minutes, then finish with 1-2 minutes under the broiler. Position the steel on the top rack about 6 inches from the broiler.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the best cheese for New York style pizza?</summary>
<p>Whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella. Grande, Galbani, and Polly-O are preferred brands. Always buy blocks and shred yourself. Pre-shredded cheese contains anti-caking agents that prevent proper melting. Fresh mozzarella is too wet for NY style.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does my pizza dough shrink back when I stretch it?</summary>
<p>The gluten is too tight. Let the dough sit at room temperature for 60-90 minutes before stretching. If it keeps snapping back, set it down, cover it, wait 10-15 minutes, then resume. Never use a rolling pin, which crushes the air bubbles and produces a dense texture.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is New York water really necessary for good pizza?</summary>
<p>No. The New York water myth has been thoroughly debunked. While New York City has excellent soft water with low mineral content, blind taste tests consistently show that water source has minimal impact on pizza quality compared to flour type, fermentation time, oven temperature, and technique. A properly made dough with bread flour and 72-hour cold ferment produces excellent pizza with any municipal tap water.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I reheat leftover New York style pizza?</summary>
<p>Use a skillet on the stovetop. Place the slice in a cold non-stick pan, cover with a lid, and heat on medium-low for 5-7 minutes. The bottom re-crisps from the direct heat while the trapped steam melts the cheese. This method produces results that are nearly as good as fresh pizza. The microwave makes pizza rubbery. The oven dries it out. The skillet method is superior to both.</p>
